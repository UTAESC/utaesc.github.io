# Executive Officers

Listed below are the executive officers for the 2015-2016 term.

## President: Abira Syed

My name is Abira Syed and I am the current president of the Engineering Student Council. I am an incoming Junior in Manufacturing Systems and Industrial Engineering. 

First and foremost, it is an honor and utmost privilege to serve you as your president. As president, my main goals for the upcoming school year are to unite the National Association of Engineering Student Councils (NAESC) with the UTAESC Chapter, unite the different engineering organizations and enhance the engineering educational experience by creating educational workshops as well as having activities/events for the engineering students. It is crucial to create leading and well-rounded engineers in this booming economy and it is my duty to serve the College of Engineering.

## Vice President: Luis Nunez

My name is Luis Salas Nunez, I'm pursuing a double major in aerospace and mechanical engineering, and I'm the vice president of the engineering student council for the 2015-2016 term. I became involved in the ESC after the NAESC regional conference held at Missouri, in 2014. It was one of the most enriching experiences I have experienced during my college life. It made me realize how a good Student Council can be extremely beneficial for the student body. At the same time I realized the long road that we at UTA have ahead. However, I believe that we have a great human talent, and that working together we can gain more recognition and improve the college experience for the students. I invite the student body to approach us, we are here to serve you.

## Secretary: Omar Ramirez

Hello everyone! My name is Omar Ramirez and I am the current secretary for the Engineering Student Council and a Mechanical Engineering major. Before joining ESC I attended many of their conferences and General Body Meetings to get an idea of the opportunities ESC offers. Through my experience I found that ESC allowed me to put into practice the skills necessary to be successful in an internship or in a job within my field of study. As a result, I felt obligated to give back to the organization by becoming their secretary. As secretary it’s my job to aid Abira Syed, the current president, by keeping every officer inform on the task each one of them needs to perform. I look forward to an outstanding year and helping ESC expand like it deserves to.

## Treasurer: Enrique Mustieles

My name is Enrique Mustieles; I am an international senior student majoring in Industrial and Manufacturing Systems Engineering. The reason why I am so passionate about my degree, specifically about the business aspect of it, is the same reason why I believed I would be the perfect fit for the Treasurer position of the Engineering Student Council at The University of Texas at Arlington. I’ve learned that money is one of the most relevant elements an organization can have and every organization needs a good leader to create and manage a good budget. Thus, one of the things I hope to accomplish during my office term is to bring income to the organization from different sources. To mention a few ideas on how to do this would be to work with the Fundraising Chair of the organization to plan and execute fundraisers as well as build and maintain relationships with different sponsors.

## Internal Communications: Fawaad Khan

My name is Fawaad Hyder Khan. I have been an International peer advisor, a tutor, and a Chief Event coordinator in my Undergraduate in Electronics and Communication Engineering. I am now pursuing my Masters in EE at UTA. Recently, I have been involved a lot on campus in organizations such as GSS, UTA volunteers, MUN, MAVS for UNICEF, S.H.A.C. and joined the ESC board as the Internal Communications Chair. I intend to make ESC stronger than ever by bringing all the fellow technical organizations and students under one strong umbrella.

## External Communications: Archana Mohan

Hello Everyone! My name is Archana Mohan. I am currently pursuing Masters in Computer Science from The University of Texas at Arlington. I will be serving as the External Communication Chair for the upcoming year.

As an External Communication Chair, my responsibility includes contacting companies & alumni and arranging for sponsorships, which will help our organization’s monetary needs. As a part of betterment of our knowledge of the industry, I would like to arrange for some speakers who will address our audience regarding the current market trends and give us firsthand account of what is expected of our graduates. I will also be communicating with various companies (specifically related to the College of Engineering) and getting them to attend our Career Fairs. More companies equal more opportunities for our students!!

## Public Relations: Pauline Nguyen

Hi everyone! My name is Pauline Nguyen, and I’m currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science. I will be this year’s ESC Public Relations Chair, and I’m also the Maverick Billiards club’s Vice President! As your PR Chair, I think it’s important to be able to communicate to others the essence of engineering in a way that makes it both empowering and interesting to people that may be unfamiliar with what engineering is. In a world where technology continues to improve and affect the lives of people, the way we present UTA’s engineering program through media is equally important.

In layman’s terms, what I do is create ESC flyers, posters, trifolds, shirt designs, and advertisements. I’ll also be updating ESC social media such as the Facebook page, Instagram, and Twitter accounts. Furthermore, I’m often found with my DSLR, so if you’re at one of our events, smile for the camera!

## Fundraising Chair: Cesar Aguilera

Me llamo Cesar Aguilera. I was appointed Fundraising Chair for the Engineering Student Council in the spring of 2015. I am a sophomore at UTA pursuing a B.S. in Electrical Engineering. As the Fundraising Chair I would like to raise money through various events which would benefit the Engineering Student Council tremendously. I hope by joining the ESC I can do my part in making it an even better organization.

## Webmaster: Michael Theriot

My name is Michael Theriot. I first began programming in middle school and now I'm a software engineering major at UTA. I've been involved in the CSE department as a teaching assistant for two semesters and I'm now the webmaster officer for the ESC. My goals during my term are to set up a website and make it an easier platform for students to get involved.
